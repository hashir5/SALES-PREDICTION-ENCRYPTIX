**Store Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning and Python**
**Abstract**
This project focuses on predicting store sales using machine learning techniques in Python. The objective is to forecast the sales of various stores based on the attributes provided in the dataset. Predictive analytics allows us to identify and analyze the factors that influence retail sales. By leveraging different machine learning algorithms, we aim to determine the most effective approach for our problem statement. Our methodology includes both traditional regression techniques and advanced boosting algorithms, with the latter yielding superior results.

**Introduction**
Sales prediction is a critical component of modern business intelligence, though it often presents challenges due to issues such as insufficient data, missing values, and outliers. This task is inherently a regression problem rather than a time series analysis. Experience shows that regression techniques can provide more accurate results compared to time series methods. Machine learning algorithms, particularly those that are tree-based, excel at identifying complex patterns in sales data through supervised learning.

**Methodology**
During the data exploration phase, it was observed that some stores were not operational. This confirmed that there were no closed stores with sales and no open stores without sales, allowing us to safely exclude these from the dataset. A clear correlation between the number of customers and sales was identified, which was further validated by analyzing sales trends across different days of the week. It was noted that state holidays in the dataset did not include Easter, making predictions for test data containing Easter more challenging. Additionally, promotional activities were found to significantly impact sales, while school holidays had a minimal effect. Further exploration revealed that certain store types showed stronger correlations with both sales and customer numbers.

Given the discrete nature of many dataset components, such as day of the week, year, assortment, and store type, decision trees were deemed an appropriate starting point. This model helped in understanding the significance of various features, confirming that customer numbers and average sales per customer were critical factors. We then applied ensemble methods, including AdaBoost and Random Forest, which improved validation set performance by 0.0608 and 0.0599, respectively. Notably, Random Forests exhibited reduced variance compared to the AdaBoost method. The XGBoost algorithm, employing gradient-boosted trees, was ultimately used to predict store sales with high accuracy.

**Results**
While AdaBoost sometimes provided better scores and variance compared to Random Forests, XGBoost delivered exceptional results with the given dataset. Interestingly, the feature importance rankings from XGBoost differed from those of other models. Average sales per month or per day of the week did not contribute to significant improvements, likely due to extrapolating data where none existed in the test set, leading to potential overfitting. Despite these challenges, the predictions generated for the stores were accurate and reliable.
